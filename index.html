<div id="kMeansSummary">
  <p>In order to further understand what makes certain nursing homes different from other, we decided to utilize a
    K-means clustering algorithm in order to identify features that might make one nursing home better or worse than
    another. There were 33 features used in this analysis the most important ones being:</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Provider_id</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Facility_name</p>
  <p>&#x2022; City</p>
  <p>&#x2022; State</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Distinct_beneficiaries_per_provider</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Total_snf_medicare_standard_payment_amount</p>
  <p>&#x2022; White_beneficiaries</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Black_beneficiaries</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Average_hcc_score</p>
  <p>
    The k-means algorithm identified 4 clusters. Cluster A has 2840 nursing homes, Cluster B has 693 homes, Cluster C
    has 1688 homes, and Cluster D has 147 homes. Looking a little closer at the features in the clusters, Group A has
    the lowest HCC scores with a mean of 2.25 indicating the healthiest population. The total SNF charges are also the
    lowest, with an average of $1.54 million. The average medicare parents and beneficiaries are also the lowest with
    average values of $962k and 79 respectively. This analysis tells us that the “best” nursing facilities, indicated
    by the HCC score, are the ones that take the fewest Medicare patients. We also see the second largest difference
    in
    White and Black beneficiaries, with 158k more White beneficiaries than Black. In fact, looking closer at the
    distribution of the bar plots, we see the mean of the curve around 65 beneficiares/nursing home for White
    beneficiaries while the curve for Black beneficiaries has a mean of 10 but doesn’t have enough data to produce a
    cohesive plot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cluster B has an average HCC score on the higher side, 2.41. It also has the second highest total SNF charges,
    distinct beneficiaries, and total SNF medicare payments, with average values of $7.78M, 328, and $4.72M. This
    group supports significantly more Medicare patients than cluster A despite only containing 693 nursing homes, 76%
    less than group A. This group also contains a slightly larger group of Black beneficiaries (around 35k with a mean
    of 51/home) and slightly fewer White beneficiaries (174k, mean 250/home) than Group A with a 139k difference
    between
    the two races.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cluster C has the highest HCC score (2.45), but for total SNF charges ($3.9M), distinct beneficiaries (179), and
    total SNF medicare payments ($2.4M), it lands somewhere between group A and B. This cluster has the second largest
    number of nursing homes (1688) but the largest number of beneficiaries (283k). It also supports the largest total
    number of Black beneficiaries (51k) but the distribution has a heavy left skew with a mean of 30.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cluster D is the smallest group with only 147 nursing homes. It has the second lowest HCC score of 2.34, and the
    largest total SNF charges ($16.1M), distinct beneficiaries (580), and total SNF medicare payments ($9.1M). Despite
    having the fewest number of homes, this group handles over 56% of the total Medicare payments. It also has the
    highest means of White and Black beneficiaries per home, 435 and 84 respectively.
