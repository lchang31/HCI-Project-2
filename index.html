<!-- Introduciton -->
<p>After the recent pandemic and in recent years, there has been a greater focus on medical wellness across the United
  States. Thus, there are many different institutions to help people in need and most are growing over time. Of the many
  different types of care provided, a few forms are Home Health Agencies, Nursing Homes, Hospice Care, and General Care.
</p>
<p>
  To address the different types of care, we must clarify what each one is. By definition, a home health agency (HHA) is
  a service provider that provides aid to the patient where the patient is currently living instead of the patient
  coming to the provider for aid. A nursing home is a place that people are sent to when they do not necessarily need a
  hospital, but can not be properly cared for at their home. Hospice care is a service that provides aid for people with
  terminal health conditions where they can get the proper care they need to have as easy a time as possible. Lastly,
  general care is aid provided where the beneficiary travels to a medical site to receive aid in some form.
</p>
<p>
  The dataset that we looked at contained a large amount of data detailing racial and gender backgrounds for different
  locations of nursing homes, hospice centers, and home health agencies. It also provides data for the amount of money
  the providers charged individuals in addition to the amount of money that medicare covered for the people that
  required medical aid. The data set information is largely gathered from the years 2011-2015, so we can examine if
  there is any bias between race or gender for the amount of money beneficiaries are paying or the amount that medicare
  is covering.
</p>
<p>

  Some notable terms that need to be defined in order to understand the data set are HCC scores, what beneficiaries are,
  and what SNF charges are. HCC scores are the output of a scoring system which measures how healthy an individual is
  with scores less than 1 being healthy and scores higher than 1 being in some degree of risk. Beneficiaries are people
  who receive that aid from someone else and are, in this scenario, the patients receiving medical aid. Lastly, SNF
  charges are defined as Skilled Nursing Facility charges and are charges billed to the beneficiaries for treatment
  received. In addition, patients who qualify for Medicare, a federal health insurance, have their bills partially or
  fully covered by the government. Medicaid, on the other hand, is an assistance program to help cover low income
  patients’ medical expenses.
</p>
<p>
  Considering this background, this data now becomes relevant in a social justice environment as we can analyze whether
  patients with Medicare or Medicaid coverage get billed more or less depending on race, gender, and location. People
  with low income or who are qualified for Medicare might be targeted more compared to normal patients for higher costs
  and Medicare, in response to constant usage of their service for a given person, might cover less of the expenses in
  return. Not every person using government provided aid is receiving the same amount of aid, and we want to look at if
  these trends show through our data analysis.

<div id="Pie_Graph" style="float: left">

  <h2>Race</h2>
</center>
<p>
  A look at the distribution of race shows that white beneficiaries in the US account for about 85.38% of all
  beneficiaries across states in the US. Whereas in comparison, black beneficiaries come in second with only 9.84% of
  beneficiaries. Hispanic beneficiaries come in third with 3.66% and then Asian Pacific Islander beneficiaries,
  American Indian or Alaska Native beneficiaries and lastly other unknown beneficiaries with 1.0%, 0.2% and 0.05%
  respectively.
</p> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
<center>
  <h2>Gender</h2>
</center>
<p>
  By taking a look at the number of male and female beneficiaries for different states, we see that in all states,
  there exist more female beneficiaries than male beneficiaries. This is probably due to the fact that there is an
  upper bound or fixed quota to the number of male and female beneficiaries per state. In some states, such as
  Florida, it differs by as much as 30,000 people but on average by only about 10,000 people.

  <h2>HCC Scores</h2>
</center>
<p>
  According to the CMS, a higher HCC score indicates a higher risk of chronic diseases while a lower HCC score
  indicates a healthier population. We see that the state with the highest average HCC score is California and by
  comparison, the state with the lowest happens to be Puerto Rico with 1.3. There is also a wide difference between the
  maximum and minimum HCC score. In California for example, the maximum HCC Score is 9.15 and the minimum is 1.11.
  Similarly in Ohio, the maximum HCC score is 7.07 and the minimum score is 0.85.

<div id="kMeansSummary">
  <p>In order to further understand what makes certain nursing homes different from other, we decided to utilize a
    K-means clustering algorithm in order to identify features that might make one nursing home better or worse than
    another. There were 33 features used in this analysis the most important ones being:</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Provider_id</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Facility_name</p>
  <p>&#x2022; City</p>
  <p>&#x2022; State</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Distinct_beneficiaries_per_provider</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Total_snf_medicare_standard_payment_amount</p>
  <p>&#x2022; White_beneficiaries</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Black_beneficiaries</p>
  <p>&#x2022; Average_hcc_score</p>
  <p>
    The k-means algorithm identified 4 clusters. Cluster A has 2840 nursing homes, Cluster B has 693 homes, Cluster C
    has 1688 homes, and Cluster D has 147 homes. Looking a little closer at the features in the clusters, Group A has
    the lowest HCC scores with a mean of 2.25 indicating the healthiest population. The total SNF charges are also the
    lowest, with an average of $1.54 million. The average medicare parents and beneficiaries are also the lowest with
    average values of $962k and 79 respectively. This analysis tells us that the “best” nursing facilities, indicated
    by the HCC score, are the ones that take the fewest Medicare patients. We also see the second largest difference
    in
    White and Black beneficiaries, with 158k more White beneficiaries than Black. In fact, looking closer at the
    distribution of the bar plots, we see the mean of the curve around 65 beneficiares/nursing home for White
    beneficiaries while the curve for Black beneficiaries has a mean of 10 but doesn’t have enough data to produce a
    cohesive plot.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cluster B has an average HCC score on the higher side, 2.41. It also has the second highest total SNF charges,
    distinct beneficiaries, and total SNF medicare payments, with average values of $7.78M, 328, and $4.72M. This
    group supports significantly more Medicare patients than cluster A despite only containing 693 nursing homes, 76%
    less than group A. This group also contains a slightly larger group of Black beneficiaries (around 35k with a mean
    of 51/home) and slightly fewer White beneficiaries (174k, mean 250/home) than Group A with a 139k difference
    between
    the two races.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cluster C has the highest HCC score (2.45), but for total SNF charges ($3.9M), distinct beneficiaries (179), and
    total SNF medicare payments ($2.4M), it lands somewhere between group A and B. This cluster has the second largest
    number of nursing homes (1688) but the largest number of beneficiaries (283k). It also supports the largest total
    number of Black beneficiaries (51k) but the distribution has a heavy left skew with a mean of 30.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cluster D is the smallest group with only 147 nursing homes. It has the second lowest HCC score of 2.34, and the
    largest total SNF charges ($16.1M), distinct beneficiaries (580), and total SNF medicare payments ($9.1M). Despite
    having the fewest number of homes, this group handles over 56% of the total Medicare payments. It also has the
    highest means of White and Black beneficiaries per home, 435 and 84 respectively.

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
</center>
<p>
  For our preliminary analysis we were able to look at race and gender distributions of medicare beneficiaries. We
  found that there were the most white beneficiaries and overall a larger number of female beneficiaries across all the
  states. We also looked at HCC scores and found that California had the highest HCC score and Puerto Rico had the
  lowest HCC risk score.
</p>
<p>

  After performing our k-means clustering, we found that the better” nursing homes (Cluster A), homes with a lower HCC
  score, tend to support fewer Medicare patients and in that difference also support fewer Black beneficiaries (average
  of 10/home). This group also supported the lowest number of White beneficiaries per nursing home (average of 65 per
  home) possibly indicating that a larger number of self-funded patients provides more money to support the well-being
  of patients at these centers. The groups with the highest HCC scores (Clusters B, C) supported a large number of
  Medicare beneficiaries per home, 51 Black, 251 White and 30 Black, 137 White respectively. Surprisingly, the group
  with the largest number of beneficiaries, which also made up over 65% of all medicare payments, had the second lowest
  HCC score and was able to support on average 84 Black beneficiaries and 435 White beneficiaries per nursing home
  (Cluster D). This group was also the smallest of the clusters, with only 147 homes. While there is some correlation
  between a lower HCC score and the number of Medicare patients as well as with the number of Black beneficiaries, this
  final group indicates that the relationship is slightly more nuanced. A closer look at some of the facilities in
  cluster D indicated that it contains medium - extra large facilities, providing a rationale as to how they are able to
  support a larger number of beneficiaries.
</p>
<p>
  Future work might consider incorporating the sizes of facilities into the analysis, data that we, unfortunately, were
  not provided. We would also like to perform further analysis on the income distributions of the beneficiaries and
  explore if there is a difference in how much charge medicare may cover.
